# Improving a website
In the group project this year you will build a better version of an existing website. This entails:

Starting the project: What roles do you have? What website should you improve? Decide on a platform to plan and communicate. Start writing you project plan (which will eventually turn into your project documentation). 

1. Evaluating the old website: What problems can you identify?

2. Writing down a product specification for a redesigned webpage

3. Make a prototype for a new website. First prototype on paper, then interactive prototype in Wordpress. 

This work is iterative, which means you will have to evaluate, test, respec, develop several times. I want at least three documented cycles. For the basic work structure, see canvas page The phases of a design project. 

## Requirements for this project:

- A sketch of the website.
- An interactive prototype in Wordpress
- User tests, at least one with sketch, one with interactive prototype, and one with product.
- Code should be validated (html, css, WCAG validation at least).
- A working website. 
- Process documentation including test documentation, validation documentation, and references to literature.
- Project documentation (description of your finished product).
- Code and documentation in your project depository on git.ssis.nu.
- Roles that should be defined in the project documentation:

### Given roles:
- Project manager (About Face)
- Prototyping (Design of Everyday Things)
- Testing (Don't Make Me Think)
- Content structure (Evil By Design)


### To distribute within the group:
- WCAG
- Presentation
- Graphics
- Wordpress
- Styling (css)
- Coding (HTML)
